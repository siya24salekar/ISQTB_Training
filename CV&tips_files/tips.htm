      <P class="style62">CV &amp; Resume Tips for Software Testers</P>
      <P class="style47">				&nbsp;</P>
      <P class="style47">				1. Know the purpose of your CV/resume<BR><BR>
      				Some people write a resume as if the purpose of the document was 
      				to land a job. As a result they end up with a really long and 
      				boring piece that makes them look like desperate job hunters. 				The 
      objective of your resume is to land an interview, and the 				interview 
      will land you the job (hopefully!).<BR><BR>				2. Back up your qualities 
      and strengths<BR><BR>				Instead of creating a long (and boring) list with 
      all your 				qualities (e.g., disciplined, creative, problem solver) try 
      to 				connect them with real life and work experiences. In other 
      				words, you need to back these qualities and strengths up, else 				it 
      will appear that you are just trying to inflate things.<BR><BR>				3. Make 
      sure to use the right keywords<BR><BR>				Most companies (even smaller 
      ones) are already using digital 				databases to search for candidates. 
      This means that the HR 				department will run search queries based on 
      specific keywords. 				Guess what, if your resume doesn’t have the 
      keywords related to 				the job you are applying for, you will be out even 
      before the 				game starts.<BR><BR>				These keywords will usually be 
      nouns. Check the job description 				and related job ads for a clue on 
      what the employer might be 				looking for. You can read more about resume 
      keywords on the 				article Tapping the Power of Keywords to Enhance Your 
      Resume’s 				Effectiveness.<BR><BR>				4. Use effective titles<BR><BR>
      				Like it or not, employers will usually make a judgment about 				your 
      resume in 5 seconds. Under this time frame the most 				important aspect 
      will be the titles that you listed on the 				resume, so make sure they 
      grab the attention. Try to be as 				descriptive as possible, giving the 
      employer a good idea about 				the nature of your past work experiences. 
      For example:<BR><BR>				Bad title: Accounting<BR>				Good title: 
      Management of A/R and A/P and Recordkeeping<BR><BR>				5. Proofread it 
      twice<BR><BR>				It would be difficult to emphasize the importance of 
      				proofreading your resume. One small typo and your chances of 
      				getting hired could slip. Proofreading it once is not enough, so 
      				do it twice, three times or as many as necessary. If you don’t 
      				know how to proofread effectively, here are 8 tips that you can 
      				use.<BR><BR>				6. Use bullet points<BR><BR>				No employer will have 
      the time (or patience) to read long 				paragraphs of text. Make sure, 
      therefore, to use bullet points 				and short sentences to describe your 
      experiences, educational 				background and professional 
      objectives.<BR><BR>				7. Where are you going?<BR><BR>				Including 
      professional goals can help you by giving employers an 				idea of where 
      you are going, and how you want to arrive there. 				You don’t need to 
      have a special section devoted to your 				professional objectives, but 
      overall the resume must communicate 				it. The question of whether or not 
      to highlight your career 				objectives on the resume is a polemic one 
      among HR managers, so 				go with your feeling. If you decide to list 
      them, make sure they 				are not generic.<BR><BR>				8. Put the most 
      important information first<BR><BR>				This point is valid both to the 
      overall order of your resume, as 				well as to the individual sections. 
      Most of the times your 				previous work experience will be the most 
      important part of the 				resume, so put it at the top. When describing 
      your experiences 				or skills, list the most important ones 
      first.<BR><BR>				9. Attention to the typography<BR><BR>				First of all 
      make sure that your fonts are big enough. The 				smaller you should go is 
      11 points, but 12 is probably safer. Do 				not use capital letters all 
      over the place, remember that your 				goal is to communicate a message as 
      fast and as clearly as 				possible. Arial and Times are good 
      choices.<BR><BR>				10. Do not include “no kidding” information<BR><BR>
      				There are many people that like to include statements like 
      				“Available for interview” or “References available upon 				request.” 
      If you are sending a resume to a company, it should be 				a given that 
      you are available for an interview and that you 				will provide 
      references if requested. Just avoid items that will 				make the employer 
      think “no kidding!”<BR><BR>11. Explain the benefits of your skills<BR><BR>
      				Merely stating that you can do something will not catch the 
      				attention of the employer. If you manage to explain how it will 
      				benefit his company, and to connect it to tangible results, then 
      				you will greatly improve your chances.<BR><BR>				12. Avoid 
      negativity<BR><BR>				Do not include information that might sound negative 
      in the eyes 				of the employer. This is valid both to your resume and to 
      				interviews. You don’t need to include, for instance, things that 
      				you hated about your last company.<BR><BR>				13. Achievements instead 
      of responsibilities<BR><BR>				Resumes that include a long list of 
      “responsibilities included…” 				are plain boring, and not efficient in 
      selling yourself. Instead 				of listing responsibilities, therefore, 
      describe your 				professional achievements.<BR><BR>				14. No 
      pictures<BR><BR>				Sure, we know that you are good looking, but unless 
      you are 				applying for a job where the physical traits are very 
      important 				(e.g., modeling, acting and so on), and unless the employer 
      				specifically requested it, you should avoid attaching your 				picture 
      to the resume.<BR><BR>				15. Use numbers<BR><BR>				This tip is a 
      complement to the 13th one. If you are going to 				describe your past 
      professional achievements, it would be a good 				idea to make them as 
      solid as possible. Numbers are your friends 				here. Don’t merely mention 
      that you increased the annual 				revenues of your division, say that you 
      increased them by 				$100,000, by 78%, and so on.<BR><BR>				16. One 
      resume for each employer<BR><BR>				One of the most common mistakes that 
      people make is to create a 				standard resume and send it to all the job 
      openings that they 				can find. Sure it will save you time, but it will 
      also greatly 				decrease the chances of landing an interview (so in 
      reality it 				could even represent a waste of time). Tailor your resume 
      for 				each employer. The same point applies to your cover 
      letters.<BR><BR>				17. Identify the problems of the employer<BR><BR>				A 
      good starting point to tailor your resume for a specific 				employer is 
      to identify what possible problems he might have at 				hand. Try to 
      understand the market of the company you are 				applying for a job, and 
      identify what kind of difficulties they 				might be going through. After 
      that illustrate on your resume how 				you and your skills would help to 
      solve those problems.<BR><BR>				18. Avoid age discrimination<BR><BR>
      				It is illegal to discriminate people because of their age, but 
      				some employers do these considerations nonetheless. Why risk the 
      				trouble? Unless specifically requested, do not include your age 				on 
      your resume.<BR><BR>				19. You don’t need to list all your work 
      experiences<BR><BR>				If you have job experiences that you are not proud 
      of, or that 				are not relevant to the current opportunity, you should 
      just 				omit them. Mentioning that you used to sell hamburgers when you 
      				were 17 is probably not going to help you land that executive 
      				position.<BR><BR>				20. Go with what you got<BR><BR>				If you never 
      had any real working experience, just include your 				summer jobs or 
      volunteer work. If you don’t have a degree yet, 				mention the title and 
      the estimated date for completion. As long 				as those points are 
      relevant to the job in question, it does not 				matter if they are 
      official or not.<BR><BR>				21. Sell your fish<BR><BR>				Remember that 
      you are trying to sell yourself. As long as you 				don’t go over the 
      edge, all the marketing efforts that you can 				put in your resume (in 
      its content, design, delivery method and 				so on) will give you an 
      advantage over the other candidates.<BR><BR>				22. Don’t include 
      irrelevant information<BR><BR>				Irrelevant information such as political 
      affiliation, religion 				and sexual preference will not help you. In fact 
      it might even 				hurt your chances of landing an interview. Just skip 
      it.<BR><BR>				23. Use Mr. and Ms. if appropriate<BR><BR>				If you have a 
      gender neutral name like Alex or Ryan make sure to 				include the Mr. or 
      Ms. prefix, so that employers will not get 				confused about your 
      gender.<BR><BR>				24. No lies, please<BR><BR>				Seems like a no brainer, 
      but you would be amused to discover the 				amount of people that lie in 
      their resumes. Even small lies 				should be avoided. Apart from being 
      wrong, most HR departments 				do background checks these days, and if you 
      are buster it might 				ruin your credibility for good.<BR><BR>				25. 
      Keep the salary in mind<BR><BR>				The image you will create with your 
      resume must match the salary 				and responsibility level that you are 
      aiming for.<BR><BR>				26. Analyze job ads<BR><BR>				You will find plenty 
      of useful information on job ads. Analyze 				no only the ad that you will 
      be applying for, but also those 				from companies on the same segment or 
      offering related 				positions. You should be able to identify what 
      profile they are 				looking for and how the information should be 
      presented.<BR><BR>				27. Get someone else to review your resume<BR><BR>
      				Even if you think you resume is looking kinky, it would be a 				good 
      idea to get a second and third opinion about it. We usually 				become 
      blind to our own mistakes or way of reasoning, so another 				people will 
      be in a good position to evaluate the overall 				quality of your resume 
      and make appropriate suggestions.<BR><BR>				28. One or two pages<BR><BR>
      				The ideal length for a resume is a polemic subject. Most 				employers 
      and recruiting specialists, however, say that it 				should contain one or 
      two pages at maximum. Just keep in mind 				that, provided all the 
      necessary information is there, the 				shorter your resume, the 
      better.<BR><BR>				29. Use action verbs<BR><BR>				A very common advice to 
      job seekers is to use action verbs. But 				what are they? Action verbs 
      are basically verbs that will get 				noticed more easily, and that will 
      clearly communicate what your 				experience or achievement were. Examples 
      include managed, 				coached, enforced and planned. Here you can find a 
      complete list 				of action verbs divided by skill category.<BR><BR>
      				30. Use a good printer<BR><BR>				If you are going to use a paper 
      version of your resume, make 				sure to use a decent printer. Laser 
      printers usually get the job 				done. Plain white paper is the preferred 
      one as well.<BR><BR>				31. No hobbies<BR><BR>				Unless you are 100% sure 
      that some of your hobbies will support 				you candidacy, avoid mentioning 
      them. I know you are proud of 				your swimming team, but share it with 
      your friends and not with 				potential employers.<BR><BR>				32. Update 
      your resume regularly<BR><BR>				It is a good idea to update your resume 
      on a regular basis. Add 				all the new information that you think is 
      relevant, as well as 				courses, training programs and other academic 
      qualifications 				that you might receive along the way. This is the best 
      way to 				keep track of everything and to make sure that you will not end 
      				up sending an obsolete document to the employer.<BR><BR>				33. 
      Mention who you worked with<BR><BR>				If you have reported or worked with 
      someone that is well known 				in your industry, it could be a good idea 
      to mention it on the 				resume. The same thing applies to presidents and 
      CEOs. If you 				reported to or worked directly with highly ranked 
      executives, 				add it to the resume.<BR><BR>				34. No scattered 
      information<BR><BR>				Your resume must have a clear focus. If would cause 
      a negative 				impression if you mentioned that one year you were studying 
      				drama, and the next you were working as an accountant. Make sure 
      				that all the information you will include will work towards a 
      				unified image. Employers like decided people.<BR><BR>				35. Make the 
      design flow with white space<BR><BR>				Do not jam your resume with text. 
      Sure we said that you should 				make your resume as short and concise as 
      possible, but that 				refers to the overall amount of information and not 
      to how much 				text you can pack in a single sheet of paper. White space 
      				between the words, lines and paragraphs can improve the 				legibility 
      of your resume.<BR><BR>				36. Lists all your positions<BR><BR>				If you 
      have worked a long time for the same company (over 10 				years) it could 
      be a good idea to list all the different 				positions and roles that you 
      had during this time separately. 				You probably had different 
      responsibilities and developed 				different skills on each role, so the 
      employer will like to know 				it.<BR><BR>				37. No jargon or 
      slang<BR><BR>				It should be common sense, but believe me, it is not. 
      Slang 				should never be present in a resume. As for technical jargon, do 
      				not assume that the employer will know what you are talking 				about. 
      Even if you are sending your resume to a company in the 				same segment, 
      the person who will read it for the first time 				might not have any 
      technical expertise.<BR><BR>				38. Careful with sample resume 
      templates<BR><BR>				There are many websites that offer free resume 
      templates. While 				they can help you to get an idea of what you are 
      looking for, do 				not just copy and paste one of the most used ones. You 
      certainly 				don’t want to look just like any other candidate, do 
      you?<BR><BR>				39. Create an email proof formatting<BR><BR>				It is very 
      likely that you will end up sending your resume via 				email to most 
      companies. Apart from having a Word document ready 				to go as an 
      attachment, you should also have a text version of 				your resume that 
      does not look disfigured in the body of the 				email or in online forms. 
      Attachments might get blocked by spam 				filters, and many people just 
      prefer having the resume on the 				body of the email itself.<BR><BR>
      				40. Remove your older work experiences<BR><BR>				If you have been 
      working for 20 years or more, there is no need 				to have 2 pages of your 
      resume listing all your work 				experiences, starting with the job at the 
      local coffee shop at 				the age of 17! Most experts agree that the last 
      15 years of your 				career are enough.<BR><BR>				41. No fancy design 
      details<BR><BR>				Do not use a colored background, fancy fonts or images 
      on your 				resume. Sure, you might think that the little flowers will 
      cheer 				up the document, but other people might just throw it away at 
      				the sight.<BR><BR>				42. No pronouns<BR><BR>				You resume should not 
      contain the pronouns “I” or “me.” That is 				how we normally structure 
      sentences, but since your resume is a 				document about your person, 
      using these pronouns is actually 				redundant.<BR><BR>				43. Don’t 
      forget the basics<BR><BR>				The first thing on your resume should be your 
      name. It should be 				bold and with a larger font than the rest of the 
      text. Make sure 				that your contact details are clearly listed. 
      Secondly, both the 				name and contact details should be included on all 
      the pages of 				the resume (if you have more than one).<BR><BR>				44. 
      Consider getting professional help<BR><BR>				If you are having a hard 
      time to create your resume, or if you 				are receiving no response 
      whatsoever from companies, you could 				consider hiring a professional 
      resume writing service. There are 				both local and online options are 
      available, and usually the 				investment will be worth the money.</P>
