      <P class="style35"></P>
      <P class="style35"><STRONG>One week before the exam</STRONG></P>
      <P class="style35">		OK, so you have now booked your exam. The week 
      leading up to the exam 		should be spent reading through the course 
      material again. But this time 		after each chapter, stop and ask yourself 
      questions about what you have 		just read. This way you can ensure you are 
      taking in the information and 		understand it fully</P>
      <P class="style35">		Take the practice quizzes included in the course. If 
      you get a question 		wrong, review the question and determine why you got 
      the answer wrong. 		You can always read the associated section again in 
      the course.</P>
      <P class="style35">		If there is something you are not sure about, don't 
      forget if you have 		signed up for the 'Silver' training package, you can 
      ask your course 		tutor.</P>
      <P class="style35">		Its natural to feel anxiety before any exam. So try 
      and look at the big 		picture. You can always re-take the exam if it 
      doesn't go to plan, its 		not the end of the world. By repeatedly doing 
      the practice quizzes, you 		can build your confidence levels prior to 
      taking the exam.</P>
      <P class="style35">		&nbsp;</P>
      <P class="style35"><B>		One day before the exam</B></P>
      <P class="style35">		Try to ensure you have a relaxing evening planned the 
      night before your 		exam. Some people like to study the night before, but 
      this different for 		each individual. You may be better off relaxing and 
      simply doing 		something you enjoy instead. By now, you have done the 
      studying, so its 		just a matter of getting in the right frame of mind for 
      the exam.</P>
      <P class="style35">		Make sure you know how to get to the exam centre. 
      Maybe print out a 		route and have it ready to take with you. If you are 
      taking a bus or 		train to get there, make sure you have double-checked 
      the times. You 		don't want to have to rush anything on the day of your 
      exam. Se if there 		is a place nearby to the exam centre to get a drink 
      and relax before the 		exam.</P>
      <P class="style35">		&nbsp;</P>
      <P class="style35"><STRONG>Exam day</STRONG></P>
      <P class="style35">		Its here at last, the day you have been waiting for. 
      This is your way to 		demonstrate your knowledge of software testing. The 
      hard work has been 		done, you have done all the studying you need to do, 
      and now you can 		prove to yourself how much you know.....its going to be 
      fun!</P>
      <P class="style35">		Plan to leave for your exam with plenty of time to 
      spare, the last thing 		you want to have to do is rush out of the house 
      and panic about getting 		there on time.</P>
      <P class="style35">		Make sure you take a drink with you. Most exam 
      centre's allow drinks to 		be taken into the exam, check with them first 
      when you book the exam. A 		drink is really useful during the exam, as it 
      makes you stop thinking 		for a few seconds and acts like a short break 
      which can help you 		immensely.</P>
      <P class="style35">		The exam will be multiple-choice. It is very 
      important you answer every 		question there, you won't get any marks for 
      not answering. You should be 		able to eliminate at least one or two 
      incorrect answers, which then 		leaves you with a simpler decision to make 
      for your attempt at the right 		answer.</P>
      <P class="style35">		In order to pass the exam you need to score 26 
      correct answers out of a 		possible 40. This needs to be achieved in one 
      hour. The questions are 		not long or complex, so you should have plenty 
      of time to spend on each 		question.</P>
